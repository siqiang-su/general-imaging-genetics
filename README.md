# A General framework of Brain Region Detection and Genetic Variants Selection in Imaging Genetics
This repository includes the Python code for the paper `A General framework of Brain Region Detection and
Genetic Variants Selection in Imaging Genetics`.

## Environment and usage
- Python 3.9

## Description

The folder `simulation` contains the main script and functions that are needed to implement simulation studies. The file `Alternating_Minimization.py` includes the alternating minimization algorithm and function for hyper-parameter selection via modified BIC criterion. The file `Joint_Generation.py` includes the functions for simulation data generation. The true signal shapes used in the paper are saved as `1-block.npy`, `3-block.npy` and `butterfly.npy` under this folder as well.
