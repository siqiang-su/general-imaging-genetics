## Description

The `simulation` directory houses the primary scripts and functions required for conducting simulation studies. The `Alternating_Minimization.py` file encompasses the alternating minimization algorithm and a function for hyper-parameter selection using a modified BIC criterion. The `Joint_Generation.py` file contains functions for generating simulation data. The true signal shapes utilized in the associated paper are stored as `1-block.npy`, `3-block.npy`, and `butterfly.npy` within this directory.

The `example` directory includes a Python script that guides you through the process of data generation, hyper-parameter tuning, model fitting, and model evaluation.
